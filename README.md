# Enhancing Cybersecurity Situational Awareness through Human-Centric Visualisation

## Project Aim

Security Situational Awareness (CSA) refers to the human capacity to analyse cybersecurity threats in its environment and adapt accordingly. CSA plays an important role in identifying risks and the following decision making for mitigating security risks in multiple domains. Visualisation can provide effective and efficient insights into overwhelming amounts of data, thus facilitating people to explore the cybersecurity situation at different levels that aid in decision making. This project aims to enhance cybersecurity situational awareness through human-centric visualisation by means of developing a prototype software tool. The prototype consists of two main functions: 1) heterogenous cybersecurity data (e.g., logs, machine-readable data, text, etc.) are collected, stored, and ingested through pre-processing; 2) the processed cybersecurity-related data are transferred to human-centric presentations supported by visualisation. The target stakeholders of the tool are non-expert in cybersecurity, which will be allowed to explore and analyse large amounts of data and quickly identify trends and unexpected events, enabling decision-making and proactive actions.
